# qsp-modeling-with-python (pqsp) by Kamaldeen
Python codes to facilitate quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) modeling.
(Please see below to code-manual to read about me)

### See details below for step by step running of the codes

PS: you will find very little comments in the codes and that is the reseaon I have (1) explain each folder and .py files here (2) attached a pdf file indicating the same thing: pqsp-CodeManual (3) made a short introductory video of the code - . 

I prefer clean and well organized (see through) codes. For more details on PK modeling (history, formulation and analytic solutions), see

### General overview - pqsp-CodeMaunal

#### Pharmacokinetic modeling


I have included the default one-and two-compartment models with simulations that will require only the model parameter inputs.

These models also use the simulation time and simulation plots mentioned above.

#### pqsp One-compartment model

#### pqsp Two-compartment model
Same as above but with the equation given by



### About me

Kamaldeen is an applied mathematician by training and he has a profound interest in quantitative pharmacology research. Specifically, he is interested in designing, analyzing and simulating pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models to help inform pre-clinical development of drugs.

##### Kamaldeen:
PK/PD modeling is interesting and I have enjoyed it so far. I enrolled in the HMX Fundamentals program (Harvard Medical School online learning platform) for Pharmacology and immunology to improve my basic knowledge of the pharmacology, necessary to design PK/PD models.

I look forward to a career as a QSP modeler and expert in a pharmaceutical research industry (and maybe in the near future - in an academic environment as I love to teach).

I have spend time and enjoyed reading qsp-related articles, especially, to update myself on qsp modeling tools. Most notable qsp modeling tools include R, NONNEM, Phoenix Winnonlin by , SymBiology - Matlab. 

While several articles have used these tools to analyze and characterize different drugs and dosage regimens, some researchers have carried out survey on the usage and user experience of these tools - this I found very thoughful of the authors as well as important for the progress of qsp modeling.

I will not be discussing about the result of the survey, but instead to highlight the fact that no Python-driven qsp code was highlighted in the article, despite in the increasing popularity of Python for simulations.

This is not to say that these tools are not efficient as I have only used SymBiology, but most importantly, I want to contribute to the available modling tools, to use Python to develop, analyze and simulate qsp models.

And also, to boost my profile during job application and interviews (hopefully).
