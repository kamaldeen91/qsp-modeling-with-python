# qsp-modeling-with-python (pqsp) by Kamaldeen
Python codes to facilitate quantitative system pharmacology (QSP) modeling

### About me

First, Kamaldeen is an applied mathematician by training and he has a profound interest in quantitative pharmacology research. Specifically, he is interested designing, analyzing and simulating pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models to inform pre-clinical development of drugs.

##### Kamaldeen:
PK/PD modeling is interesting and I have enjoyed it so far. I enrolled in the HMX fundamental program for Pharmacology and immunology to improve my basic knowledge of the pharmacology, necessary to design PK/PD models.

I look forward to a career as a QSP modeller and expert in a pharmaceutical company (and maybe in the near future - in an academic environment as I love to teach).

I have spend time and enjoyed reading qsp-related articles, especially, to update myself on qsp modeling tools. Most notable qsp modeling tools include NONNEM, Winnonlin by , SymBiology - Matlab. While several articles have used these tools to analyze, characterize or recommend drugs and different dosage regimens, some researchers have carried out survey on the usage and user experience of these tools - this I find very thoughful of the research and important for the continuous development of qsp modeling tools.

I will not be discussing about the result of the survey, but instead to highlight the fact that no Python-driven qsp code was highlighted in the article, despite in the increasing popularity of python for machine learning and data analysis.

This is not to say these tools are not efficient - I have not tried everything myself except SymBiology. More importantly, I want to contribute to the available modling tools. That is why I have spend time writing this qsp modeling, analysis and simulation in Python.

And also, to boost my profile during job application and interviews (hopefully).

Enough said! Lets start coding!


### See details below for step by step running of the codes

First, when it comes to coding, I like clean and well organized (see through) codes, so you will find very little comments in the code. That is why I have (1) explain each folder and .py files here (2) attached a pdf file indicating the same thing - code manual (3) made a short introductory video of the code.
